# Vectorfitting
This is a from scratch pure python implementation of the fast relaxed vectorfitting algorithm for MIMO frequency domain data. Different modes (standard VF, relaxed VF and fast relaxed VF) are implemented. Matrix shaped frequency domain data is supported, and a model with common poles is fitted

$$
\mathbf{H}_{fit}(s) 
=
\mathbf{D}
+
s \cdot \mathbf{E}
+
\sum_{k=1}^{n} \mathbf{R}_{k} \cdot \frac{1}{s - p_k}
$$

where $\mathbf{D}$ is the constant term, $\mathbf{E}$ is the linear term and $\mathbf{R}_{k}$, $p_k$ are the (possibly complex) residues in matrix form and poles.
